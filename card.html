			<p class="fun-fact">Panthers can run at speeds of up to 35 mph, helping them to catch up with fast prey such as deer and antelope. 
			   They are also incredibly agile, and are able to leap up to 20 ft. in pursuit of their prey. 
			   Another one of the more unique panther facts relates to their climbing ability. Of all the big cats, panthers are some of the very best at climbing.

			<p>A panther is defined as a melanistic color variant of other species in the Panthera genus, which includes tigers, lions, jaguars and leopards. 
			   This color variant usually means that the cat is black or dark brown, since melanism is the development of melanin, a dark-colored pigment in the skin. 
			   A panther is therefore usually either a black leopard in Asia and Africa, known as Panthera pardus, or a black jaguar in the Americas, known as Panthera onca.
